h2. Secret Key Cryptography

There is a stupid bug in Listing 5 on page 35, the transposition cipher. JavaScript arrays are assigned by reference, so @this._keys@ and @this._sorted_keys@ both point to the same array. Using a well-known trick, this can be rectified by replacing line 5 with

<pre>
  this._sorted_keys = this._keys.slice(0).sort();
</pre>

The code in the repository has been updated accordingly.
